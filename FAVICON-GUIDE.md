# 🎨 FAVICON INSTALLATION GUIDE

I created 2 favicon designs for you to choose from!

---

## 🎯 DESIGN OPTIONS:

**Option 1: favicon.svg** (Fancy)
- Large "A" with small "S"
- Dark green background with circular accent
- More artistic/unique

**Option 2: favicon-simple.svg** (Clean) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- Simple "AS" text
- Dark green background
- Clean and professional

## 📥 HOW TO ADD YOUR FAVICON:

### STEP 1: Choose Your Design

Download and look at both favicons above. Pick the one you like!

### STEP 2: Add to Your GitHub Repo

1. Go to https://github.com/aidansherin123/ascopy-portfolio
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Upload your chosen favicon file
4. **IMPORTANT:** Rename it to exactly `favicon.svg` (if you chose the simple one, rename "favicon-simple.svg" to "favicon.svg")
5. Click "Commit changes"

### STEP 3: Update index.html

1. Click on `index.html` in your GitHub repo
2. Click the ✏️ pencil icon to edit
3. Find this line (should be line 4):
   ```html
   <meta charset="UTF-8" />
   ```
4. Add this line RIGHT AFTER it:
   ```html
   <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
   ```
5. Click "Commit changes"
